= Simple docker container for svg-term-cli

https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli[`svg-term`] is
great to convert an https://asciinema.org/[ascinema] cast 
to an animated SVG.

image:docker-build-rec.svg[animated parrot]

== Motivation

I didn't want to install NodeJS/npm on my system.

== Usage

Since svg-term runs in a container, I didn't want to use volumes, 
although it's certainly possible. The most simple usage would be

[source, shell]
----
$ asciinema rec -c "docker build --tag svg-term-cli-docker ." docker-build-rec.json

$ docker run --rm -i svg-term-cli-docker \
  < docker-build-rec.json \
  > docker-build-rec.svg
----

Tip for big SVG, it may be useful to tweak node mmeory settings, e.g.
passing `--memory=5g -e NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"`.

== Installation

[source, shell]
----
$ docker build --tag svg-term-cli-docker .
